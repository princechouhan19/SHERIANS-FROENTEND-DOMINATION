# SHERIANS-FROENTEND-DOMINATION
This repo contains my structured code and practice files from the Sheriyans Frontend Development Course. Includes HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Grid, Animations, and mini projects. Each module is organized in folders for easy access, revision, and portfolio use. Ideal for beginners and self-learners.
